## How to upload

    - We cant Work on the same File at the same time (duh)
    - I will Tell about changes Ive made to the repo on Dscrd
    - So will you
    - If so, Pull Repository before you start working
    - I will Check each change made and Comit (Probably)
    - After The code is Complete, Copy the folder somewhere else and Change Icons in the Icon Folder, (Best if you keep the same names)
