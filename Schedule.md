# We will Edit it in parts, and you will Copy the whole folder for yourself later

## After The code is Complete, Copy the folder somewhere else and</br> Change Icons in the Icon Folder, (Best if you keep the same names)

### How to upload

    - We cant Work on the same File at the same time (duh)
    - The bot will inform of comits, which are to be pushed AFTER youre done editing, by clicking the small sync icon on the bottom left
    - So will you
    - If so, Pull Repository before you start working (Like Right Now))
    - I will Check each change made and Comit (Probably)

### Task for the day

Will start working on the book tab at 1015h (Vid 6)
