## How to upload

    - We cant Work on the same File at the same time (duh)
    - I will Tell about changes Ive made to the repo on Dscrd
    - So will you
    - If so, Pull Repository before you start working (Like Right Now))
    - I will Check each change made and Comit (Probably)
    - After The code is Complete, Copy the folder somewhere else and</br> Change Icons in the Icon Folder, (Best if you keep the same names)
    - Install All the things today and Let me know when you do cuz Qt Designer is a little Tricky When it will come to Opening the Library.ui File.
    - All changes Autosavee in your Editing window when you go anywhere else.
    - Make your First Proper Commit, enter something into the Message box and hit ctrl+enter like what? ANYTHING
