# How to setup your own database:

### While the database does work, you wouldnt want your work to clash with fellow users would you?

Plus, the cloud database i used take upto 100mb of data and take one user at a time.

So to make your own DB:

1. #### Use the SQL included and put it in your localDB

2. #### Setup a cloud DB

- [ ] Create an account at [remotemysql](https://remotemysql.com/)
- [ ] Login and navigate to databases, then Log in to the new place (youll know)

- [ ] Replace the info of the db in the python file.
- [ ] Import the sql file here to the Cloud (If you cant figure that out by looking at the remotemysql.com database page.... Youre hopless)

##### Incase something goes wrong in exporting to cloud:
