### How to upload

    - We cant Work on the same File at the same time (duh)
    - The bot will inform of comits, which are to be pushed AFTER youre done editing, </br>by clicking the small sync icon on the bottom left
    - So will you
    - If so, Pull Repository before you start working (Like Right Now))
    - I will Check each change made and Comit (Probably)
